  "description": "This template helps you to create an intelligent document assistant that cananswer questions from uploaded files.It shows a complete single-vector RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systemthat automatically processes documents, lets you chat with it in naturallanguage and provides accurate, source-cited responses.The workflow consists of two parts: the data loading pipeline and RAG AI Agentthat answers your questions based on the uploaded documents.To test tis workflow, you can use the following example files in a shared GoogleDrive folder[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1BevhU5qdgNDFbK4D9oAYGeK0Dt5sEaxQ].💡 Find more information on creating RAG AI agents in n8n on the official page[https://n8n.io/rag/].🔗EXAMPLE FILESThe template uses the following example files in the Google Docs format: 1. German Data Protection law: Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG) 2. Computer Security Incident Handling Guide (NIST.SP.800-61r2) 3. Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders from 2024🚀HOW TO GET STARTED 1. Copy or import the template to your n8n instance. 2. Create your Google Drive credentials via the Google Cloud Console and add them to the trigger node \"Detect New Files\". A detailed walk-through can be found in the n8n docs [https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/]. 3. Create a Qdrant API [https://qdrant.tech/] key and add it to the \"Insert into Vector Store\" node credentials. The API key will be displayed after you have logged into Qdrant and created a Cluster. 4. Create or activate your OpenAI API [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys] key.1️⃣ IMPORT YOUR DATA AND STORE IT IN A VECTOR DATABASE✅ Upload files to Google Drive.IMPORTANT: This template supports files in Google Docs format. New files will bedownloaded in HTML format and converted to Markdown. This preserves the overalldocument structure and improves the quality of responses. * Open the shared Google Drive folder * Create a new folder on your Google Drive * Activate the workflow * Copy the files from the shared folder to your new folderThe webhook will catch the added files and you will see the execution in your\"Executions\" tab.Note: If the webhook doesn’t see the files you copied, try adding them to yourGoogle Drive folder from the opened shared files via the Move to feature.✅ Chunk, embed, and store your data with a connected OpenAI embedding model andQdrant vector store.A Qdrant collection – vector storage for your data – will be createdautomatically after the n8n webhook has caught your data from Google Drive. Youcan name your collection in the \"Insert into Vector Store\" node.2️⃣ ADD RETRIEVAL CAPABILITIES AND CHAT WITH YOUR DATA✅ Select the database with imported data in the “Search Documents” sub-node ofan AI Agent.✅ Start a chat with your agent via the chat interface: it will retrieve datafrom the vector store and provide a response.❓You can ask the following questions based on the example files to test thisworkflow: * What are the main steps in incident handling? * What does Warren Buffett say about mistakes at Berkshire? * What are the requirements for processing personal data? * Do any documents mention data breach notification?🌟ADAPT THE WORKFLOW TO YOUR OWN USE CASE * Knowledge management - Query company docs, policies, and procedures * Research assistance - Search through academic papers and reports * Customer support - Build agents that reference product documentation * Legal/compliance - Query contracts, regulations, and legal documents * Personal productivity - Chat with your notes, articles, and saved contentThe workflow automatically detects new files, processes them into searchablevector chunks, and maintains conversation context. Just drop files in yourGoogle Drive folder and start asking questions.💻 📞Get in touch with me[https://www.linkedin.com/in/yulia-dmitrievna-1112361b5/] if you want tocustomise this workflow or have any questions.",
